## Development Principles

- **KISS** - Keep it simple, no over-engineering
- **YAGNI** - Don't build features "just in case"
- **Speed** - "Last month is sooo history"
- **Authenticity** - "We don't sell our souls"
- **IRL Focus** - "Vibe coding happens IRL"

## Getting Started

This project is in the initial planning phase. Check [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for current sprint tasks and [PRD.md](./PRD.md) for detailed requirements.
